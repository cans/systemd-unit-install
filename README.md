systemd-install-unit
====================

Install and setup systemd units.


This role expects each unit to be describe by an item following the schema below:

    - directory: "/some/other/path"     The directory in which install the unit (default: `systemd_unit_install_dir`)
      remote: True                      Whether the path in `unit` related to the local or the remote machine host (default: False)
      unit: "/path/to/unit.service"     The path to the unit file (_with_ the `.service`, `.timer, ...)
      user: True                        Whether to install/run the service as a per-user (not system-wide) service.
      state: "started"                  Whether the unit should set to start on next boot, immediately or never.
                                        Admissible values: "disabled" (don't start), "enabled" (start on next boot) or "started" (start immediately)

      roles:
         # install a bunch of units from files on the remote machine
         - role: cans.systemd-install-unit
           systemd_unit_install_remote: True

         # install a bunch of units from local files

             - unit: units/wonderful.service
               directory: /usr/local/etc/systemd/system
             - unit: units/critical.service
               state: "started"
